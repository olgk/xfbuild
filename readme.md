# Project Abandoned

There's a simpler D2 port of xfBuild which uses TangoD2 here: https://github.com/SiegeLord/xfbuild

I won't be maintaining this port anymore. The codebase would need a serious rewriting effort in order to make it multithread-safe (it currently uses shared hashes which causes all sorts of racing issues).
